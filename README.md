# Windows 10 Dark Theme High Contrast
Provides a much nicer alternative high contrast theme to use as a dark theme for Windows 10.

Features:
* Dark address bar in Chrome
* Dark theme in Edge/IE/Office/Explorer/etc.
* Reduces eye strain in low light environments

#### Installation
```
Simply double click the W10-DarkTheme.theme file for Windows to automatically install and apply the theme.
Pressing left-alt + left-shift + print-screen will automatically switch out of high contrast mode to your previous theme.
```

#### Uninstall
```
Unselect theme via Control Panel/Change the Theme
Delete W10.DarkTheme.theme from %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes
```

#### Contributions welcome
I would love to see a dark-solarized theme in the future.
